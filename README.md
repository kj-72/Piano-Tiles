Piano Tiles is an interactive, fast-paced game that challenges players to press the correct keys at the right time. The game is designed to run on the DE1-SoC development board, where the C code is compiled and executed for a smooth and responsive experience.

1. Interactive UI
A user-friendly, intuitive interface to enhance the gameplay experience.

2. Single Input Keys
Designed for easy, responsive control with single-key input for precise action.

3. Dynamic Difficulty in Arcade Mode
The game becomes more challenging as you progress, with tile speed increasing and delay between tiles decreasing the more tiles you press correctly.

4. Custom Play Options
Create a personalized game experience by setting custom speeds, difficulty levels, and lives to match your desired challenge level.

5. Feedback Messages
Real-time pop-up messages provide feedback on your timing accuracy, letting you know if your key press was "early," "late," or "on time."

6. Variable Scoring Based on Accuracy
Scores are dynamically calculated based on how accurately you press each tile, rewarding precise timing with higher points.
